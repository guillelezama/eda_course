# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Course - 2024 Edition

Welcome to the 2024 edition of the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** course, part of the Specialization in Economics with a Data Science option. This course was **taught in Spanish** and provides students with the necessary tools to perform exploratory analysis on various types of datasets, covering a broad range of techniques from basic statistics to advanced EDA methods such as time series and text data analysis.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to guide students through the process of exploratory data analysis, focusing on real-world datasets and problems. Throughout the course, students gained practical experience in data cleaning, visualization, transformation, and analysis using **Google Colab** for interactive notebooks. The course is structured into 10 classes, each with its own notebook that introduces specific topics and techniques.

Additionally, each folder contains a set of **slides** that were used during the corresponding class.

There is a folder called homework with the five homework assignments and the final project (in spanish).
